ABSTRACT
a TUN is an interface for capturing the raw IP packets of your machine.
On the client side, the TUN will intercept any IP packets being sent out
and make them available to your client program to send to you VPN. 
On the server side, the server recieves raw IP packets over TCP or UDP
and writes them to its TUN which routes them to its final destination. 
the response from the destination is then sent to the server TUN to be read and send back to the client over TCP/UDP. When the client socket recieves
its raw packet, it writes it back to the tun which routes it back to the 
proper program. The TUN is capable of routing packets into your own device
and out to a network depending on the IP header of the packet.
